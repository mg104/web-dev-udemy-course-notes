HTML:

1.) Tags: <h1> ; Elements: <h1>*text*</h1>
2.) Headings: <h1> to <h6>
3.) Paragraphs: <p></p> ; Used to separate lines from each other
4.) Horizontal rule: <hr /> ; Used to insert a horizontal line
5.) Break: <br /> ; Used to separate lines WITHIN A PARAGRAPH (not making new paragraph)
6.) Ordered lists: Used to make numbered lists ;
        
    Code:
    <ol>My Items:
        <li>Item 1</li> <---li tag means "list item"
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ol>
    
    Output:
    My Items:
        1. Item 1
        2. Item 2
7.) Unordered lists: Used to make lists with bullet points;

    Code:
    <ul>My Items:
        <li>Item 1</li> <---li tag means "list item"
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
    
    Output:
    My Items:
        . Item 1
        . Item 2

8.) Attributes: Some elements can have attributes with values. These elements are known as Anchor elements. Note that attribute values are always enclosed within quotes, to distinguish them from the other HTML code (like tags, etc)

    Code: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google<a>
    Output: Google
        When you click on Google above, it takes you to Google.com in the browser.

9.) Image elements: <img src="image location" alt="image description"/> ; This is like a void element (no text) and hence doesn't have a closing tag. It is used to display an image. src is used to specify image location (on the internet or local) and alt is used to describe images for the visually impaired who might use screen-reader.

10.) Image elements can go inside Anchor (<a>) tags:

    Code: <a href="..."> 
                <img src="" />
          </a>
    Output: An image that contains embedded link. When we hover mouse over the image it turns into a "hand" and we can click on it to go to the embedded link in <a> tag.

11.) While embedding pages or images into a website, you can use absolute paths (absolute paths like in linux) or relative paths (relative to the location of the html page in which you're referring to the embedded page or image) using ./ or ../ syntax.

12.) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to add styling to HTML. There are 3 ways of adding CSS styling to an HTML file:

    a.) Inline: Mention the styling inside the tag of the element that you want to style:
        Code : <html style="style-attribute:style-value">...</html>
        This will only style the particular element, and is generally not used.

    b.) Internal: Mention the styling anywhere in the HTML document that you want to add style to:
        Code:   <html>
                    <style>
                        html{
                            style-attribute:style-value
                        }
                    </style>
                </html>
        This applies the styling only to a particular html page only and the styling cannot be applied to multiple pages at once from only this code.
        Put the code for css in <head> for this.

    c.) External: Mention the styling as a XYZ.css (like: styles.css or main.css, or anything else) in the project files, and add the mention to this file in the html files.
        Code:   
                index.html:

                <html>
                    <link 
                        rel="stylesheet" 
                        href="./styles.css"
                    />
                </html>

                styles.css:

                html{
                    style-attribute:style-value
                }
        This is the most commonly used way of adding css styling to html pages.
        Put the code for css in <head> for this.

13.) CSS Selectors: In .css files, select the HTML elements to style in the following manner:
    
    a.) For selecting all elements with tag abc: abc{}
    b.) For selecting all elements having class=class-value: .class-value{} 
    c.) For selecting all elements having id=id-value: #id-value{}
    d.) For selecting all elements having tag abc with attribute1: abc[attribute1]{}
    e.) For selecting all elements with tag abc having attribute1="attribute1-value": abc[attribute1="attribute1-value"]{}
    f.) For selecting all elements in a page: *{}
